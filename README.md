# WSPRTx

A Teesny based [WSPR](http://www.wsprnet.org) transmitter. 

The code here is mainly for my own selfish purposes of having something to easily pick back up again, with libraries and Makefiles included. It was originally built with the TeensyDuino IDE but I have moved it over to a makefile based system.

Not intended to be used in a 'turn-key' fashion, but check out [WSPRLite](https://www.github.com/AliBarber/WSPRLite) and [AD9834](https://www.github.com/AliBarber/AD9834) which I split out as libraries that could be used as a standalone parts of a similar project.
